# ChainStream Edge Devices

We currently provide a ChainStream Client App for Android, allowing Android devices to quickly connect to the ChainStream system.

At present, the app can only be installed by compiling from source, which is somewhat cumbersome. We will provide an APK installation package as soon as possible, so please stay tuned to our official website.

The interface shown in the diagram is a screenshot from the current version of the ChainStream Client App. The small window displays the real-time camera feed, which is simultaneously streamed to the corresponding stream on the local server.
