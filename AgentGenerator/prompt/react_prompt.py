(1) CODE<<`agent_code`>>, you need to write the agent code in the middel of `<<>>`ï¼Œand this action will executes the `agent_code` in the sandbox environment and returns the error message and reference document if any.
(2) FINISH<<`finish_message`>>, you need to write the `finish_message` in the middle of `<<>>`, and this action means the mission is finished.

Note that you can only submit one agent code or finish with message per step, and the runtime will return the format error message or the sandbox error message in Observation step, you can't write any code or message in Observation step, even don't write `Observation:` in the end of the response.

REACT_EXAMPLE = """
Here is an examples:

Mission: Your mission is to programme an agent with chainstream framework to get the following output streams:
('streams', [StreamDescription(stream_id='summary_by_sender', description='A list of email summaries grouped by each email sender, excluding ads', fields={'sender': 'name xxx, string', 'summary': 'sum xxx, string'})])
There are multiple input streams available. The agent should select some of them:
('streams', [StreamDescription(stream_id='all_email', description='All email messages', fields={'sender': 'name xxx, string', 'Content': 'text xxx, string'})])
